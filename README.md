# BigMike's Guitar Tabs

BigMike's Guitar tabs is a website where anyone can submit guitar tabs for their favorite songs. Each tab that is submitted will be on the front page and will include a picture of the artist if one is available from the API that is used. 

I decided to make BigMike's guitar tabs because I hadn't seen a tab website that with a simple, easy to use tabbing process that also let you view tabs easily. Almost all of the tabbing websites I saw required you to pay to use a tabbing tool, required an app download, and/or were not mobile friendly at all. 

BigMike's Guitar Tabs uses a SQL database, which is hosted on JawsDB via Heroku. For front-end design, the Materialize CSS library is used, and for backend and routing functions Node and Express are used.
